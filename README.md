## Obsrevations

Founds two interesting answers from model output:
1) For question "how to write resume for Data science position ?"
--> It has written the answer specific to data science field.
   
2) For question "write python code to Combine two lists and remove duplicates without using set function"
--> provided the code with no use of set() python code as expected.

## Future Work

-- Fine tune the model with custom data for specific use case
-- Improve accuracy
